# Font System Detector

A Chrome browser extension that detects and displays all font combinations found on web pages. The extension provides both scanning and interactive hover modes to help developers and designers identify fonts used on any webpage.

## Features

-   **Font Scanning**: Automatically scans the current webpage and identifies all unique font combinations (family, size, weight, and line-height)
-   **Organized Display**: Fonts are grouped by family, then sorted by size and weight for easy browsing
-   **Hover Mode**: Interactive mode that highlights elements and displays their font properties when you hover over them
-   **Side Panel Interface**: Clean, accessible interface that opens in Chrome's side panel
-   **Real-time Highlighting**: Visual feedback with blue outlines when hovering over elements in hover mode
